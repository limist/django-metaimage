django-metaimage is an app for the Django web framework; it provides a
wrapper of useful functionality around ImageModel from
django-photologue, which it requires.  It is GPL-licensed.  

Some of the code was initially borrowed from Pinax's photo app.


OVERVIEW
--------

Many if not most websites need to deal with images, sometimes uploaded
from users, and sometimes retrieved from a remote site.  The
django-metaimage app is meant to help your Django site/app by
providing you a class, MetaImage (inherits from django-photologue's
ImageModel) providing useful, image-relevant attributes and methods.

MetaImage attributes include:

- title, slug, caption, source_note (for attribution text, copyrights, etc.)
- source_url
- privacy, safetylevel
- tags

MetaImage methods include:

- A save() method that can automatically download a remote image to
  your filesystem, so you'll always have a local copy should the
  remote image vanish into the Internet aether.  - render(), which
  spits out the HTML to show your image on a webpage.

Basic views, tests, and templates are also provided.


INSTALLATION
------------

After installation via pip, just add metaimage to your Django project
settings.py file, in the INSTALLED_APPS list.  You may also want to
update your sitewide urls.py if you want to use MetaImage's pages.
