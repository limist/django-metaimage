django-metaimage is an app for the Django web framework; it provides a
wrapper of useful functionality around ImageModel from
django-photologue, which it requires.  It is GPL-licensed.  

Some of the code was inspired/borrowed from Pinax's photo app, but I
have removed Pinax dependencies, so that django-metaimage only
requires Django itself, django-photologue, and django-tagging.


OVERVIEW
--------

Many if not most websites need to deal with images, sometimes uploaded
from users, and sometimes retrieved from a remote site.  It's useful
to track metadata about such images, including tags and local binary
copies of remote images. The django-metaimage app is meant to help
your Django site/app by providing you a class, MetaImage (inherits
from django-photologue's ImageModel) providing useful, image-relevant
attributes and methods.

MetaImage attributes include:

- title, slug, caption, source_note (for attribution text, copyrights, etc.)
- source_url
- privacy, safetylevel
- tags

MetaImage methods include:

- A save() method that can automatically download a remote image to
  your filesystem, so you'll always have a local copy should the
  remote image vanish into the Internet aether.  
- render(), which spits out the HTML to show your image on a webpage.

Basic views, tests, and templates are also provided.


INSTALLATION
------------

After installation via "pip install django-metaimage" or from source,
just add "photologue", "tagging" and "metaimage" to your Django
project settings.py file, in the INSTALLED_APPS list, e.g.

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        "photologue",
        "tagging",
        "metaimage",
        ...
        ]


And then, do a "manage.py syncdb" to create the database-side tables
needed.

Optional: Templates are provided for adding, editing, viewing, etc. of
metaimages; they're very basic and meant only as a starting point.
But if you want to use them directly, do at least these two things: 1)
get and install django-uni-form > 0.7.0, which some of the templates
rely on, and also update your setting.py INSTALLED_APPS to list
"uni_form"; 2) update your site-wide urls.py, e.g.

::

    urlpatterns = patterns("",
        ...
        (r"^metaimage/", include("metaimage.urls")),
        ...
        )


Also, many of the metaimage templates have templatetags dependencies
that are commented out, as they require Pinax or other packages; you
can activate them as needed, but be sure to update your INSTALLED_APPS
accordingly.
