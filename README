django-metaimage is an app for the Django web framework; it provides a
wrapper of useful functionality around ImageModel from
django-photologue, which it requires.  It is GPL-licensed.  Some of
the code was initially borrowed from Pinax's photo app.


RATIONALE

Many if not most websites need to deal with images, sometimes uploaded
from users, and sometimes retrieved from a remote site.
django-metaimage is meant to help your Django site/app by providing
you a class, MetaImage (inherits from django-photologue's ImageModel)
with useful image-relevant attributes and methods.

MetaImage attributes include:
- title, slug, caption, source_note (for attribution text, copyrights, etc.)
- source_url
- privacy, safetylevel
- tags

MetaImage methods include:
- A smart save() method that can automatically download a remote image
  to your filesystem, so you'll always have a local copy should the
  remote image vanish into the Internet aether.
- render(), which spits out the HTML to show your image on a webpage. 

Basic views, tests, and templates are also provided.


INSTALLATION

After installation via pip, just add metaimage to your
settings.py.INSTALLED_APPS list, and possibly update your sitewide
urls.py if you want to use MetaImage's pages.
